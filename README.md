# Blender Mind Addon

Predict your next action in Blender.

## How to install

I will think how to do it properly, but for now, **do one of**:

- Copy `addon/blender_mind` to your `Blender/2.90/scripts/addons`
- Pack `addon/blender_mind` to zip and install like any other blender addon
- For development add this repo to your scripts path (`Preferences->File Paths->Data->Scripts`).
 Reload by restarting Blender of search for `Reload Scripts` operator (does not work always)
 
## Development

- I assigned `F` to launch predictor operator for fast testing
- use `pycharm_launch_blender.py` for quick start
